# Analysis of the Risk and Return of Different Portfolio Construction Strategies

A Python-based project to analyze the expected risk and return of three different portfolio construction strategies for 5 different stocks listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange using data from December 29, 2017 to December 30, 2022. The 3 portfolio construction strategies used in this project are:

1. Equal-weighted portfolio
2. Minimum variance portfolio
3. A portfolio that maximizes µ<sub>p</sub> − <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> (σ<sub>p</sub>)<sup>2</sup>, where µ<sub>p</sub> and σ<sub>p</sub> are the expected portfolio return and the standard deviation of the portfolio return, respectively.

For each of the constructed portfolios, this project calculates the expected return and the standard deviation of return, the portfolio beta (sensitivity of the portfolio to market risk), the 1%-VaR and 5%-VaR, and the maximum drawdown (MDD) of the portfolio.
