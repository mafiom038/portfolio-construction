# Analysis of the Risk and Return of Different Portfolio Construction Strategies

A Python-based project to analyze the expected risk and return of three different portfolio construction strategies for 5 different stocks listed in the Indonesia Stock Exchange using data from the start of 2018 to the end of 2022. The 3 portfolio construction strategies evaluated in this project are:

1. Equal-weighted portfolio
2. Minimum variance portfolio
3. Maximiser portfolio

For each of the constructed portfolios, various metrics of comparison are calculated in order to derive insights on the expected returns of each porfolio given the level of risk.
